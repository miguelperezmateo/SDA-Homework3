# 1. Plot the series and briefly comment on the characteristics you observe
# (stationarity, trend, seasonality, ...) ----

## Plot observed time series
autoplot(time_series, xlab = "Time", ylab = "Approval Rate (%)")

## With respect of the trend: There is a decrease from 1994 to 2000 and an increase
## from 2000 to 2004. The global trend is to decrease: from 20% to 13.8%
### Decompose time series. Show (trend and seasonality)
plot(decompose(time_series))

## With respect of the seasonality the data is strongly seasonal according to the ggmonthplot.
## Besides, looking to the gglagplot we see the data is strongly correlated to the previous season
### Plot seasonality per month and year
ggmonthplot(time_series)
ggseasonplot(time_series)

### Exploring correlations of lagged observations
gglagplot(time_series, lag = 12, do.lines = FALSE)
ggAcf(time_series)

## Stationarity: We can see that it is not stationary because of the trend, making the mean and the
## variance change over time. However, to statiistically prove it, we performed the Augmented
## Dickey-Fuller Test and the resulting p-value was of 0.41, confirming the time series is not
## stationary
### Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test => test if x is a non-stationary time series
adf.test(time_series)

# With respect of the randomm part it does not seem as white noise.
# We can see that variance is high during 1992 and 1994 and then it is reduced
# for the rest of the time, so it doesnt match with the white nose properties
# of constant variance and mean.

# 2. Obtain a plot of the decomposition of the series, using stl(). Use an additive decomposition
# or a multiplicative one, depending on your data. Use the function forecast() to forecast
# future values.
#
# Multiplicative decomposition is useful when the logarithmic transformation
# makes a difference in the appearance of your series and shows more constant variance.
## Decompose the series
stl1 <- stl(time_series, s.window = "periodic", robust = TRUE)
stl1_multiplicative <- stl(log_time_series, s.window = "periodic", robust = TRUE)

## We use log to be able to show multiplicative decomposition: https://otexts.com/fpp2/components.html
## The remainder is much better! It seems to have constant variance and mean
## Now back-transform the data with exp

## Compare individual plots

## Check variance for residuals for both decompositions. Both are stationary
adf.test(stl1$time.series[, "remainder"])
adf.test(stl1_multiplicative$time.series[, "remainder"])

## Make a forecast with both decompositions and compare the errors
# We split our model in 2: Train and Test ( Approx 80-20%, 17 years (13, 4) )
train_end <- time(time_series)[length(time_series) - 48]   #train data end

time_series_train_split <- window(time_series, end = train_end)
time_series_test_split <- window(time_series, start = test_start)

### Using hew
# Lets check if the model is multiplicative or additive
ts1_mult <- hw(time_series_train_split, seasonal = "multiplicative")
ts1_add <- hw(time_series_train_split, seasonal = "additive")
# Using hw, the additive time series has the lowest rms, but if we chhange the training
# percentage the multiplicative is higher in other ones
accuracy(ts1_mult, time_series_test_split)
accuracy(ts1_add, time_series_test_split)

# Forecasting with stl(): different methods: naive, ets, arima, rwdrift
stl1_forecast <- forecast(stl1, method = "arima", h = 48) # arima is the one selcted
plot(stl1_forecast)

stl1_forecast_multiplicative <- forecast(stl1_multiplicative, method = "arima", h = 48) # arima is the one selcted
plot(stl1_forecast_multiplicative)

## ?
# ggAcf(residuals(ts1_mult)) #Here we can see that resuduals are much higher for mult serie
# ggAcf(residuals(ts1_add))

## ETS => Exponential Smoothing State Space Model
## If you don't specify anything, the ets() function looks for the model with lowest AIC (Akaike's
## information criteria).
# ts1_ets <- ets(ts1_train)
# summary(ts1_ets)
# autoplot(ts1_ets)

# Does the remainder look like a white noise to you? White noise is just a group of independent,
# identically distributed variables, with zero mean and constant variance. Answer to this
# point just visually or plot the ACF and PACF of the remainder part.

## The remainder using additive decomposition does not look like white noise visually
## and we will check neither statistically
remainder <- stl1$time.series[, "remainder"]
autoplot(remainder)

## The remainder using multiplicative decomposition look like white noise visually
## and statistically
remainder_multiplicative <- exp(stl1_multiplicative$time.series[, "remainder"])

## Compare variance
var(remainder) # 0.75
var(remainder_multiplicative) # Almost 0

## Compare acf and pacf

# 3. Fit an ARIMA model to your time series. Some steps to follow:
# a) Decide on whether to work with your original variable or with the log transform
# one (use plot and tsdisplay of both variables, the transformed one and the original
# one). Remember that logarithmic transformation is useful to stabilize the variance.
# If both plots look almost the same to you, just use the original data.
plot(time_series)
plot(log_time_series)

# Both models look almost the same, there is no significative difference in ACF
# nor PACF

# model_1 <- Arima(time_series, order = c(2, 1, 0), seasonal = list(order = c(0, 1, 1), period = 12))

# b) Are you going to consider a seasonal component? If the answer is yes, identify s. You
# can use the periodogram (function tsdisplay with parameter "plot.type=spectrum"),
# ACF (with significant correlations on lag s and its multiples), seasonplot() and
# monthplot(). For montlhy data, s = 12; for quarterly data s = 4. Declare this
# frequency when you define your time-series in R, regardless of including or not a
# seasonal term in your model. This will permit you to use the functions seasonplot
# (package forecast) or monthplot (built-in function).

# The answer is yes, because diagrams showed us a great seasonal component.
tsdisplay(time_series, plot.type = "spectrum") # We can see that the signal has periodic components
# from the peaks in the espectrum at 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, etc.
acf(time_series) # this doesn't help a lot...
seasonplot(time_series) #Here is hard to see significative months...
monthplot(time_series) #Here we can clearly see the cycles within months

seasonplot(time_series_quaterly)
monthplot(time_series_quaterly) # Here we can see that a pattern repeats all quarter

# We should try with s = 4 and 12

# c) Decide on the values of d and D to make your series stationary. D values are not
# usually greater than 1. You can use the standard deviation procedure and stationary
# tests (adf.test, kpss.test). Also, functions like ndiffs and nsdiffs may be useful. Don't
# be surprised if that group of tools give you contradictory results. Just, make decision
# to keep going. Plots of the ACF and PACF also help. If you can draw a pattern out
# of the ACF and PACF function, then stop differencing and start modelling. If that
# pattern doesn't work, then consider rethinking the part where you took differences.
